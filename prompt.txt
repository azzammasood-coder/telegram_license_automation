Layers To Automate
"Raised" Folder/layerset contains the below layersets:
16 RAISED DL - Edit the text layer named "DL 3 characters" and in it Only change letters in specific positions. (By default the DL visible in PSD is "467 149 050). In the layer this is default text: "  6     4   5  ", so change the characters at position 3, 9 and 13. For example, if the DL in barcode is: 919698127, then the updated text layer will be: "  1     9   2  ". Also for the remaining DL characters, edit the layergroup named "10 Laser Edited BOLD Text" and inside it edit the text layer "DL remaining characters", by default it contains "4  7 1  9 0  0".
17 RAISED DOB - Edit three text layers named day, month and "last two digits of year"
18 RAISED EXP - Edit three text layers named day, month and "last two digits of year"
19 RAISED TEXT SWIRL DOB - Edit one text layer. Dob format is JUN 11 87
20 RAISED SIG - replace contents on the SIG copy smart object
21 Raised Dob Text Under Big Photo - Edit one text layer named dob, date format is JUN87



Laser Folder/layerset contains the below layerset:
"9, 10, 11"Laser Edit Text -  Contains the layerset "09 Laser Swirl name" - Contains the text layer "Name" which contains the First name + Middle Name + Last name and repeat until the number of characters in the default text: ANNARDIESSLINANNARDIESSLIN. In the default case, the first name Anna, middle name R and last name Diesslin. The first two characters are size 100 px. Then the size increases by 16.67px, until the character N in the middle, at this point the size of N is 300 px, after this character the size starts decreasing by 16.67px until the last character which is now 66.67px.
To change the character sizes of this text layer, need to trigger custom script named change_laser_swirl_name.jsx, this script changes each character size on the active text layer, so you will just make the target layer active and then trigger this script, also after the custom script has been triggered and completed, then change the horizontal spacing of characters to 0 (VA icon in the character window).

""9, 10, 11"Laser Edit Text" - contains the layerset "10 Laser Edited BOLD Text" - Contains the layerset "DOB" - Contains the text layer first two digits of year. Also update the layer "ISSUE" and the layer (contains issue date in format 03/02/2024), and the layer 

""9, 10, 11"Laser Edit Text" - contains the layerset "10 Laser Edited BOLD Text" - Contains the text layers "First Name and Middle Name", "Last Name", Address First Line (street address eg 478 83RD ST FL2) and Address Second Line (city and state and zip code e.g BROOKLYN, NY 14075).

""9, 10, 11"Laser Edit Text" - Contans the layerset "11 LIGHT" - Edit the Gender text layer (M or F) and Height text layer (5'-07"), and Eye Color text layer (BRO) and Micro text layer.

Important notes:
-"11 Light" folder "Micro" Format is Exp: Month   Day Year First Name Last Name, Continuted until  fills up the space under big photo, "guide" layer  has a line that shows where it should stop. By default, this is text in Micro: "06 11 2032 Anna R Diesslin 06 11 2032 Anna R Diesslin 06 11 2032 ". So use this length.

- "13 Big Photo" Needs to be changable in grayscale only. Saved Layer File Needs to be in grayscale PNG.

-"14 Lens Face" Needs to be changable in  grayscale only. Saved Layer File Needs to be in grayscale PNG

- Each of the below layers also needs to be exported as PNG (just the layer should be visible):
